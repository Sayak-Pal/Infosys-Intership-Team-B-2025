Hi Sarah,

Are we still on for lunch tomorrow at 12:30? I found a nice Italian place near your office that looks good.

Also, I've finished reviewing the project draft you sent over. Everything looks great, but I have a couple of small suggestions for the introduction. We can discuss them physically when we meet or I can send you an email later today.

Let me know if the time still works for you.

Best appropriate,
Mark
